# EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY

A minimal keylogger example for learning about input capture and basic reporting.

**Disclaimer:** Use this code only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Misuse may be illegal.

Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies:

```
pip install pynput python-dotenv
```

Setup
- Copy ` .env.example` to `.env` and set `Email` and `Password` (use an app-specific password).

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Usage
- Run the nlogger (requires appropriate permissions):

python nlogger.py
```

That's it — minimal instructions to run for educational testing only.
